# 👋 Hi, I'm Carlos

🧠 I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer, always learning and building. I love creating useful, intuitive, and efficient applications.

🎯 Currently working with **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and **SQLite**, building full-stack projects with custom backend logic, API integrations, and frontend user experiences.

🎮 Passionate about video games and indie game development. I'm especially interested in designing complex mechanics and game systems (yes, even building game databases from scratch!).

🚀 Open to opportunities that help me grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful projects.
